    <h2>Thank You, Kobe</h2>
    <img src="images/kobe fan.jpg" alt="avatar" class="center" width="350" height="450">
    <p>A short tribute auditory documentary that I’ve created for Kobe Bryant. </p>
    <p>
        He has been one of my greatest inspirations and role models of all time. 
        My vision for this soundscape narrative is to have the listeners feel inspired and motivated by Kobe’s story, and to keep working hard to one day reach their dreams and goals. 
        This narrative is quite a long one (12 minutes and 16 seconds).
    So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride! I promise that it will be a good one :)

    <h2>Go Vote!</h2>
    <img src="images/vote.jpg" alt="avatar" class="center" width="350" height="450">
    <p> This is a PSA visual argument (in the form of a political cartoon) that I've created, 
        calling young people to act on their ideals and go VOTE in order to actually make a difference in this country.
