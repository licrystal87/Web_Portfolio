        <h3>Thank You, Kobe</h3>
        <p>A short tribute auditory documentary that Iâ€™ve created for Kobe Bryant. </p>
        <p>
            He has been one of my greatest inspirations and role models of all time. 
            My vision for this soundscape narrative is to have the listeners feel inspired and motivated by Kobeâ€™s story, and to keep working hard to one day reach their dreams and goals. 
            This narrative is quite a long one (12 minutes and 16 seconds).
        So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride! I promise that it will be a good one :)

        <h3>Go Vote!</h3>
        <p> This is a PSA visual argument (in the form of a political cartoon) that I've created, 
            calling young people to act on their ideals and go VOTE in order to actually make a difference in this country.
